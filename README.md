### Loan-Risk-Analysis
Using Machine Learning and predictive analysis telling the loan fault percentage of a customer


The main aim of the project was to reduce the number of bad loan cases in banking sector. 
Generally the loan is classified in two types:
	1. Secure Loan
	2. Insecure Loan


The entire project is about reducing the bad loan cases in secure loan. It may be further worked for insecure loan.

In today day to day life, bank usually provide loans to the customers based on the collateral (many more procedures) and CIBIL score.
If the CIBIL score is >750, you are considered to be a genuine customer and you can get your loan easily passed.  Know more about CIBIL here: https://www.creditmantri.com/cibil-score/

PROBLEM: inspite having good CIBIL score, there are cases of Bad loans. How to reduce it further?
SOLUTION:
Based on the history of customers who took loans from bank, we trained our predicitive ML model. 
The new customerâ€™s data is then passed through this model, the model will predict weather the customer will able to give back the loan amount in time or not.
We considered 29 different parameters while training the model. The accuracy of the model will increase if we are provided with more nos of parameters.

FUTURISTIC SCOPE:
1. The model can also be useful to predict the collateral cost in coming years. i.e weather the collateral is of depriciating or appriciative type.
2.  An entire Forest of Trees can be developed using geographical location of customers to increase the accuracy of the model.
3. May be helpful in predicting the character of the customer, but it would be very difficult to execute now.


#Technology used
We used generalised classification for the machine training and then we came up with the svm and random forest classifiers to reduce  the errors.
